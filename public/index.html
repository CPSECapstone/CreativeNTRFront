                        Though this is a platform for scholarship that hopes to promote open access to knowledge, the Creative Works team fully acknowledges that simly stating 'open access' does not change the systems of institutionally, inequality, and colonialism that higher education standards are built upon. This resource hopes to lessen the digital divide by access to knowledge, but is not directly changing the material inequalities that the digital divide is built upon.

                    This is a non-bolded portion of a paragraph like when users write paragraphs about their work. They could go on for quite a bit if they wanted to.
